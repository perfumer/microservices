## How to write annotations for HTTP methods

Every annotation must be written in particular Contract in src/Contract.

Every annotation after generation creates a number of things:

1. Request classes
2. Response classes
3. Method in microservice class

Request class path is generated by the next scheme:

```
src/{microservice}/Request/{model}/{action}{submodule}Request.php
```

Same as Response class:

```
src/{microservice}/Response/{model}/{action}{submodule}Response.php
```

You can customize those parameters while configuring annotation. For example:

```php
@RequestModel(microservice="crm", model="user", action="get", submodule="User", url="/user", fields={"id"}, response_fields={"user"}, request_method="get")
```

- `url` means which URL will be requested. By default equal to model value.
- `request_method` means HTTP-method
- `fields` - array of parameters to receive in json body
- `response_fields` - array of parameters to set to response content

For convenience, there a number of predefined annotations, which set some of parameters by themselves. For example:

```php
@GetModel(microservice="crm", model="user", fields={"id"})
```

is short equivalent of the full annotation above.
